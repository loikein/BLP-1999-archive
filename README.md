There are several files used in the June 1999 AER paper.  
You can download them all from this page.  
The wonders of technology.  
A caveat: All these programs are adapted to run on my own (Sun) workstation.  
If you want to run them, you will need to change all the file locations and so on.  
There may be differences between the version of Gauss for which these were written (in 1996) and the most current version.  
I've done my best to make all this stuff available, but I'm not able to answer everyone's email queries about particular programming issues. 

The main program is [base.prg](https://web.archive.org/web/20041227055838/http://www.umich.edu/~jamesl/verstuff/base.prg)

The data files that get loaded are: [panel6.asc](https://web.archive.org/web/20041227055838/http://www.umich.edu/~jamesl/verstuff/panel6.asc), [otherdat.asc](https://web.archive.org/web/20041227055838/http://www.umich.edu/~jamesl/verstuff/otherdat.asc), [lagged_erate.asc](https://web.archive.org/web/20041227055838/http://www.umich.edu/~jamesl/verstuff/lagged_erate.asc), and [otherdat3.asc](https://web.archive.org/web/20041227055838/http://www.umich.edu/~jamesl/verstuff/otherdat3.asc).

You will also need a gauss data file for the logit dependent variable (although this can be commented out of the base program.) This gauss file is [y3.fmt](https://web.archive.org/web/20041227055838/http://www.umich.edu/~jamesl/verstuff/y3.fmt). 

The library (*.lcg) files are [berry.lcg](https://web.archive.org/web/20041227055838/http://www.umich.edu/~jamesl/verstuff/berry.lcg) and [struc-inst-steve.lcg](https://web.archive.org/web/20041227055838/http://www.umich.edu/~jamesl/verstuff/struc-inst-steve.lcg). 

These library files call the following source (*.arc) files. [concat.arc](https://web.archive.org/web/20041227055838/http://www.umich.edu/~jamesl/verstuff/concat.arc), [mystat.arc](https://web.archive.org/web/20041227055838/http://www.umich.edu/~jamesl/verstuff/mystat.arc), [ownopt.arc](https://web.archive.org/web/20041227055838/http://www.umich.edu/~jamesl/verstuff/ownopt.arc), [print.arc](https://web.archive.org/web/20041227055838/http://www.umich.edu/~jamesl/verstuff/print.arc), [mydata.arc](https://web.archive.org/web/20041227055838/http://www.umich.edu/~jamesl/verstuff/mydata.arc), and [struc-inst-steve2.arc](https://web.archive.org/web/20041227055838/http://www.umich.edu/~jamesl/verstuff/struc-inst-steve2.arc). 

Best of luck and thanks for looking at this stuff.

Jim
